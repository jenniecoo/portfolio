			<h1 class="headerText">Industrial Internet Products</h1>
			<p>The industrial internet is the internet of things for big machinery, big business and big data. Designing products for this space involves an inherit understanding of complex processes, often interlaced with legacy technologies, complicated regulations and security restrictions. Processes are seeped with history, the wealth of a company is often tied to the experience and knowledge of its people, and the data solutions that are in place can be outdated and unorganized. however, the potential and appetite for improvement is immense; a 1% in efficiency improvements can result in millions of money, time and irredeemable resources saved. This all adds up to meaty design problems with real world impacts.</p>
			<p>Below is an overview of some key projects I have worked on in this discipline. The documentation and results of these projects are highly confidential and thus limited on this site; please contact me if you would like to learn more about my work.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Fastworks Design Projects</h3>
			<p>At GE Aviation, I executed multiple 'fast works' design projects. These projects used a streamlined design process based on the concepts of lean startups to accelerate a project from concept creation to MVP in 6-12 weeks. I was responsible for leading a small execution team through the process of <strong>research, co-design, ideation, implementation, validation and iteration</strong>, whilst executing in close partnership with the external customer, such as FedEx and Delta.</p>

			<p>The streamlined process allowed GE to form close relationships with partners and quickly develop new concepts to bring to market. The projects were often successful, and went on to form long-term offerings within the GE Aviation portfolio. Due to the success of these early ventures, GE Aviation formally adopted the accelerated design process, and promote this innovate customer relationship in their 'co-creation foundries'.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Disruption Recovery</h3>
			<p>The Airline Recovery tool was an example of incredible algorithms, calculating an entire airlines routes, asset and resource changes for problems as small as a 15 minute delay to as big as a east coast storm. However, 15 years of 'add on' features and no significant UI update had rendered the tool convoluted, highly complex, and usable only by highly trained subject matter experts. The goal of the project was to review and reimagine the information architecture, workflow and interaction patterns of the tool to optimize and improve the overall experience of the product.</p>

			<p>Using observational and interview research techniques with real users and subject matter experts, I identified desired goals and objectives, identified pain points and highlighted areas for improvement. I facilitated workshops that brought together team members to co-create ideas and opportunities, and worked with the PMs to prioritize and backlog items. The design concepts were developed into prototypes (sketch, pdf and clickable), tested with users and refined.</p>

			<p>The above is a simplification of the project process - the final concepts took several years to complete. During this time I was the principle designer and mangaged a contract desgin team for part of the process. Throughout the process I evangelized design thinking, user research and co-creation which resulted in a progressional improvement to the product development process and in the end, a more user-focused, competitive product.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Fleet Support</h3>
			<p>Jet Engines are monitored 24/7; a team of highly trained experts in the Aviation Operations Center receive alerts, analyze data and make maintenance decisions that can save hundreds of lives and millions of dollars. However, the information architecture around the tools was cumbersome, the workflows antiquated, and any knowledge gained from history and experience was either contained in paper files or remained in peopleâ€™s heads as tribal knowledge. The goal of the project was to reimagine the user workflow and task management, and improve processes and outcomes by capturing and reusing the knowledge within the data and community.</p>

			<p>The tool is GE internal, and we therefore had the opportunity to work closely with end users, experts and supervisors to co-create a new version of the tool. Research and design workshops informed wireframes and clickable html/css prototypes for user testing and validation. I worked closely with a design partner, who concentrated on the shorter-term designs, whilst I focused on long term vision.</p>

			<p>The end result maximised product support and service continuity for thier customers by using real time engine data to prevent operational disruptions and keep the aircraft flying; Fidelity improved by 30%, detection rates increased by 25%, and accuracy increased by 14%.The ideas and workflows from this project formed part of the foundation for GE Digitals flagship product, 'APM'.</p>
