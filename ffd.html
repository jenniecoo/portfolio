			<h1 class="headerText">Flight Deck Research</h1>
			<p>The future of flight deck design is a multi-faceted problem - aspects to consider include interface technologies, ergonomics, materials technology, crew resource management, workflow and process, and full system architecture design. Paired with a safety critical, highly regulated, technology constrained industry, it is a fascinating, complex and sometimes difficult discipline to research and develop new technologies for. As a designer, I have had to balance a focus of big picture, full spectrum concepts, with detail orientated, safety critical design aspects. The learning curve is intense, and often comes with the responsibility to teach and guide those with less technical and subject knowledge.</p>
			<p>Below is an overview of some key projects I have worked on in this discipline.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Purple Sky</h3>
			<p>The time from concept creation to idea validation in the aviation industry can often take years, and utilizes expensive commercial tools.</p>
			<p>The result of Purple Sky was a flight deck simulator that enabled the rapid design and testing of modern control interfaces such as touch, gesture and voice control. Along with a complementary design thinking process, the prototyping platform enabled a full research life cycle, from initial concepts to onboard system testing.</p>
			<p>As a flight deck design expert and UX Lead, my role included education, research, workshop facilitation, concept creation, design and testing. My work directly resulted in continued research funding, positive customer commitments and several patents.</p>

			<p>The numbers of pilots entering the workforce is rapidly decreasing. One of the most expensive aspects of running a successful airline is the cost associated with training. Onboard equipment associated with supporting two pilots results in a significant amount of development and maintenance cost, as well as </p>
