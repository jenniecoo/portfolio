				of humans and technology, developing futures based on current markets and constraints. I enjoy facilitating customer engagements 
				and leading product design, working alongside experts and team members to research new technologies and develop new products.</p>

				participatory design: bringing users, business leaders, engineers and designers together through facilitated workshops to discover 
				the most valuable problems and deliver the best solution. I have experience and skills in the full spectrum of the design process: 
				design strategy, field and lab research, user interviews, synthesis, ideation, sketching and wireframing, hi- & lo-fidelity prototyping, 
				user testing and product development.</p>

			and elephants in Africa. I have climbed mountains, kayaked rivers, zipped across quarries and waded through swamps. I have eaten 
			and drunk cuisine beyond my imagination. I have cried and laughed, sang and been silenced in every corner of this beautiful world, 
			and I have only scratched the surface…</p>
