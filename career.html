			<p class="jobDescription">
				In 2012 GE opened the 'software center of excellence' in San Ramon, and I had the oppotunity to complete an 18 month secondement as an Aviaiton liason. The concept of UX design was still new within GE, and there were only a handful of people employed who would soon grow the foundation of what became GE Digital. During this period, I learnt to communicate design thinking processes and demonstrate it's worth as an indespensable tool in the product developement life cycle.
			</p>

			<p class="jobDescription">
				In this role I conducted research and created design concepts for Airline optimisation tools. This involved conducting extensive user interviews and airline research, leading concept ideation and design, and working closely with evelopement teams to create fully interactive prototypes to be used for internal demonstrations and sales purposes.

The field research fed directly into both new and current product requirements, proving invaluable for product integrity, issue detection and requirement development.
