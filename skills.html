      <h1 class="headerText">Skills</h1>
      <p>I am a passionate and driven User Experience Designer whose key interests lie in engaging early stage opportunity research and concept 
        development. I describe myself as a full stack UX designer, in that I have experience and skills in the full spectrum of the design process. 
        I enjoy working alongside product managers, engineers, subject matter experts and fellow designers to research new technologies and develop 
        new products.</p>

      <div class="">
        <h6 id="designProcess"class="underGrad">Design Thinking</h6>
        <p>I am an avid supporter of the <strong>co-creation</strong> design process - bringing together users, engineers, business and design teams 
          to discover and develop products and services that are feasible, viable and desirable. Through planning and executing numerous co-design 
          workshops for a variety of industries, have honed excellent <strong>facilitation</strong> and <strong>communication</strong> skills, developed 
          strong business relationships and delivered tangible, actionable results.</p>

    <div id="designThinking" class="title_and_paragraph">
      <div class="">
        <h6 id="designProcess"class="underGrad">Mission Critical Design</h6>
        <p>My strengths lie in concept development and design for new products and services that solve critical, real life problems, and I enjoy working 
          on projects that are intellectually challenging and socio-technical in nature, diving deep into peopleâ€™s behaviors during high stakes situations with
          <strong>high cognitive workload</strong> such as pilots on the flight deck, or site managers in power stations.</p>
      <p>Past projects have given me the opportunity to use cutting edge technology to solve diverse problems. In particular, I have applied 
        technologies such as <strong>eye tracking, gesture, touch and voice inputs</strong> to enable HMI control in high pressure environments.</p>

    <div id="designThinking" class="title_and_paragraph">
      <div class="">
        <h6 id="designProcess"class="underGrad">Big Data</h6>
        <p>The industrial internet is the internet of things for big machinery, big business and big data. Whilst designing products for this space 
            I have developed an inherent understanding of <strong>complex processes and systems</strong>, often interlaced with legacy technologies, complicated regulations and security restrictions. 
            This work involved decoded processes that are steeped with history, where the wealth of a 
            company was often tied to the experience and knowledge of its people, and the data the under-utilized data that their assets create.  
            I have led and worked on may projects in this design space, from Lean UX proof of concepts to product deployments with real world impacts.</p>

    <div id="designThinking" class="title_and_paragraph">
      <div class="">
        <h6 id="designProcess"class="underGrad">Community</h6>
        <p>I have <strong>evangelized</strong> and taught design thinking methods to CEOs and teenagers alike. I believe strongly in <strong>mentoring</strong> 
          new designers, and helping people of all ages and talents understand the power of design thinking.</p>
        <p>I enjoy building design <strong>culture</strong> in a company and the wider community. I have volunteered to lead workshops at public meet-ups 
          and conferences, organized STEM events for young students, and have been the Master of Ceremonies for a speculative design conference for the 
          last 2 years. I enjoy <strong>public speaking</strong> and telling stories, and intend to do more of this in the future.</p>

      <div class="">
        <h6 id="prototyping" class="underGrad">Tools & Prototyping</h6>
        <p>I am proficient in many different design and prototyping <strong>tools</strong>, and find the most important skill is to be able to quickly 
          adapt and learn new technologies as the team or project requires. I utilize <strong>html, css and javascript</strong> to create prototypes and 
          test ideas. For example, I designed and coded this website myself and, by maintaining a basic knowledge of software technologies, I strive to 
          be a better designer for my engineering teams.</p>
        <p>I have worked with teams to build prototypes using web-stack technology, and more advanced technology stacks including alternative interface 
          technologies, simulation tools and embedded system technologies.</p>
