				<h3 class="">Project Use Case</h3> 
			<h1 class="headerText">Future Flight Deck</h1>
			<p>Flight deck design is a multi-faceted problem - aspects to consider include interface technologies, 
				ergonomics, materials technology, crew resource management, workflow and process, and full system architecture design. 
				Paired with a safety critical, highly regulated, technology constrained industry, it is a complex discipline to research 
				and develop new technologies for. As a designer, the challenges involve balancing a focus on big picture, 
				full spectrum concepts, with detail orientated, safety critical design aspects.</p>

				<h6>Project Overview</h6>
			<p>The time from concept creation to idea validation in the aviation industry can often take years, and utilizes expensive commercial tools.</p>
			<p>The result of Purple Sky was a flight deck simulator that enabled the rapid design and testing of modern control interfaces such as touch, 
				gesture and voice control. Along with a complementary design thinking process, the prototyping platform enabled a full research life cycle, 
				from initial concepts to onboard system testing.</p>
			<p>As a flight deck design expert and UX Lead, my role included education, research, workshop facilitation, concept creation, design and testing. 
				My work directly resulted in continued research funding, positive customer commitments and several patents.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Industrial internet</h3>
			<p>The industrial internet is the internet of things for big machinery, big business and big data. Designing products for this space involves 
				an inherit understanding of complex processes, often interlaced with legacy technologies, complicated regulations and security restrictions. 
				Processes are seeped with history, the wealth of a company is often tied to the experience and knowledge of its people, and the data 
				solutions that are in place can be outdated and unorganized. however, the potential and appetite for improvement is immense; a 1% in 
				efficiency improvements can result in millions of dollars, time and irredeemable resources saved. This all adds up to meaty design problems 
				with real world impacts.</p>
			<p>Below is an overview of some key projects I have worked on in this discipline. The documentation and results of these projects are highly 
				confidential and thus limited on this site; please contact me if you would like to learn more about my work.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Studio on Predix</h3>
			</p>Predix Studio is low code app development concept that empowers users to create applications which are bespoke to thier business needs. From first principles I developed a overarching story for the app creation tool, through visualization and data connection to publishing and deployment. Following the acquisition of a company with an aligned product story, my role pivoted to assessing and testing the usability of the acquired app, and providing a vision for a future merged concept, bringing the current product inline with the future vision.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Product Definition and Software Lifecycle</h3>
			<p>Recently I have been supporting the internal business to help define a new product offering, which has involved clarifying and validating the problem with potential customer, developing a concept journey map for the future customer experience, and designing communication pieces to help circulate the mission both internally and externally. Information on this project is limited as it has not been released externally.</p>

			<h3 class="underGrad">Fastworks Design Projects</h3>
			<p>At GE Aviation, I executed multiple 'fast works' design projects. These projects used a streamlined design process based on the concepts of lean startups to accelerate a project from concept creation to MVP in 6-12 weeks. I was responsible for leading a small execution team through the process of <strong>research, co-design, ideation, implementation, validation and iteration</strong>, whilst executing in close partnership with the external customer, such as FedEx and Delta.</p>

			<p>The streamlined process allowed GE to form close relationships with partners and quickly develop new concepts to bring to market. The projects were often successful, and went on to form long-term offerings within the GE Aviation portfolio. Due to the success of these early ventures, GE Aviation formally adopted the accelerated design process, and promote this innovate customer relationship in their 'co-creation foundries'.</p>

				<h3 class="underGrad">Fleet Support</h3>
				<p>Jet Engines are monitored 24/7; a team of highly trained experts in the Aviation Operations Center receive alerts, analyze data and make maintenance decisions that can save hundreds of lives and millions of dollars. However, the information architecture around the tools was cumbersome, the workflows antiquated, and any knowledge gained from history and experience was either contained in paper files or remained in peopleâ€™s heads as tribal knowledge. The goal of the project was to reimagine the user workflow and task management, and improve processes and outcomes by capturing and reusing the knowledge within the data and community.</p>
	
				<p>The tool is GE internal, and we therefore had the opportunity to work closely with end users, experts and supervisors to co-create a new version of the tool. Research and design workshops informed wireframes and clickable html/css prototypes for user testing and validation. I worked closely with a design partner, who concentrated on the shorter-term designs, whilst I focused on long term vision.</p>
	
				<p>The end result maximized product support and service continuity for their customers by using real time engine data to prevent operational disruptions and keep the aircraft flying; Fidelity improved by 30%, detection rates increased by 25%, and accuracy increased by 14%. The ideas and workflows from this project formed part of the foundation for GE Digitals flagship product, 'APM'.</p>
